## 💡 About This Project

Innovation Week is a celebration of creativity and resilience — transforming ideas into impact.  
This tracker was built to visualize how small actions—recycling soap, upcycling linen, smart cleaning—can create big changes in African communities.

> **“This is a community-powered CSR impact tracker—built to make every recycled bar of soap, every reused linen, and every health innovation count where it matters most: on the ground in Africa.”**
